### Quirks of the Engine

This file was started to document and give a reference to the quirks of the engine, notably this first one: [price-migration-engine/pull/1282](https://github.com/guardian/price-migration-engine/pull/1282), which presents an interesting difference between code running in AWS and code running on local. I had a vague suspicion something like that happens sometimes but never had a proof.
