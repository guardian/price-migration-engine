### What does ROW (Rest of World) means ?

Essentially an "ROW" plan refers to subscriptions that are in a given currency but not in that currency's actual region/nation. So GBP but not in the UK, USD but not in the US. These would be used in tandem with a "domestic" rate plan that is for a currency and a customer in the correct region/nation (GBP and in UK, USD and in US). 

I think most subs now would only have a "ROW" plan available in USD, but in Zuora there might be some legacy GW subs on a GBP "ROW" plan.

It's only really relevant for print products as far as I know - because of the differences in shipping costs internationally. For instance we have a dedicated delivery partner in the US and other key regions (corresponding to our key currencies) - but for other countries we use general postal providers which are more expensive. Like a customer in Mexico or Vanuatu would pay in USD, but it would be more expensive to get it delivered so we'd use the "ROW" rate.

Where it's a digital product - membership, supporter plus, etc - a "ROW" plan and pricing is not required.
