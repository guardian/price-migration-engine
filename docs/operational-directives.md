# Operational Directives

The engine strive to be a fully automatic system, but occasionaly a manual operation is required. Of course there are manual operations when setting up a new migration, but some conditions need a manual intervention from the stewards.

- The engine alarms. That typically happens in the morning and should be looked at. Nobody is immediately affected when that happens but the alarm could be related to a time critical operation.

- We observed an occurence of the processing state `EstimationStepEmptyZuoraInvoicePreview`. The actions to be taken are described in the document call "The journey of a cohort item", secion "So, what's the deal with EstimationStepEmptyZuoraInvoicePreview ?"
